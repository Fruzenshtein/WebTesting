Sample of Serenity BDD (Thucydides) project

This code is not supported since it was published. So keep in mind that the system it tests probably changed and it's not respond to the code which is provided in this repository. 
The same is applied to the Serenity BDD, because when the example was developed the testing framework was named Thucydides.
